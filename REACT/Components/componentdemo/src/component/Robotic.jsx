            <h3>Robotics is a field of science and engineering that focuses on designing, building, and programming machines capable of performing tasks automatically. These machines, known as robots, use sensors, motors, and intelligent control systems to understand their environment and act accordingly. Robotics combines elements of mechanical engineering, electronics, computer science, and artificial intelligence. Today, robots are used in industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, space exploration, agriculture, and even homes. As technology advances, modern robots are becoming more autonomous, more accurate, and more capable of working safely alongside humans.</h3>
