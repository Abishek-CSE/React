            <h3>Karnataka is rich in traditional culture, showcasing a vibrant blend of art, music, dance, festivals, and heritage. Classical dance forms like Yakshagana tell stories from Indian epics using elaborate costumes, music, and dialogue. Folk dances such as Dollu Kunitha (drum dance) and Veeragase highlight the energy and spirit of local communities. Karnataka is also known for its festivals, including Mysore Dasara, Ugadi, Karaga, and Vairamudi, celebrated with colorful processions, rituals, and folk performances. The state’s traditional music, handicrafts, temple architecture (like in Hampi and Belur), and regional cuisine further reflect its deep-rooted cultural heritage. Together, these elements preserve Karnataka’s identity and showcase its pride in centuries-old traditions.</h3>
